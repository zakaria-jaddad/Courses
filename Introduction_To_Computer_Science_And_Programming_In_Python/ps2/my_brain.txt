this is my brain fo know though i have been coding for several hours in a side project 

requirement : 
    make a function hangman 
        -> That will allow the user to play hangmanagainst the computer. 
        -> The computer picks the word, and the player tries to guessletters in the word.

    logic : 
        1.The computer must select a word at random from the list of available words that was provided in words.txt ​Note that words.txt contains words in all lowercase letters.
        2.The user is given a certain number of guesses at the beginning.
        3.The game is interactive; the user inputs their guess and the computer either:
            a.reveals the letter if it exists in the secret word
            b.penalize the user and updates the number of guesses remaining
        4. The game ends when either the user guesses the secret word, or the user runsout of guesses


Problem 2: Implemmenting helper funcitons 

    1 : is_word_guessed (secret_word : string, letters_guessed : list) => bool
        -> checkes is the current guessed letters match the word

    2:  get_guessed_word (secret_word : string, letters_guessed : list) => new string 
        -> checks is current guessed letters are in the word 
            - if True 
                -> add the leter to the list 
            - if False 
                -> ad '_ ' to the list instead of the original letter

            Output : 
                
                >>> secret_word = 'apple'  
                >>> letters_guessed = ['e', 'i', 'k', 'p', 'r', 's'] 
                >>> print(get_guessed_word(secret_word, letters_guessed)) '_ pp_ e'

        3: get_available_letters(letters_guessed : list )  => string 
            -> This function takes a list of guessed letters and return a string that has all English letters - letter_guessed list 
                - To get all English letters 
                
                >>> import string 
                >>> print(string.ascii_lowercase) abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz

            Output : 
                
                >>> letters_guessed = ['e', 'i', 'k', 'p', 'r', 's'] 
                >>> print get_available_letters(letters_guessed) abcdfghjlmnoqtuvwxyz


Problem 3 : Implemmentation The Game


Problem 4 : Game With Hints 

        1 : match_with_gaps
            this function takes the secret_word and an instance of the current guessed word 
            checks over all letters and theier index over words ....
