part A -> how long should it take you to buy a house = (save enough money) 
    - cost of dream house = total_cost
    - how much persentage shoudl you save from you paycheck to get the house = portion_down_payment asume it 25%
    - current saving should start with 0$ then moths after months increment it = current_savings = 0$
    - for annual salery = annual_salary
    - decimal amount of saved monthly money = portion_saved
    - At the end of each month, your savings will be increased by the return on your investment,plus a percentage of your ​monthly salary ​(annual salary / 12).

Implementation : 
    Write a program to calculate how many months it will take you to save up enough money for a downpayment.
    You will want your main variables to be floats, so you should cast user inputs to floats

    Your program should ask the user to enter the following variables:
        1.The starting annual salary (annual_salary)
        2.The portion of salary to be saved (portion_saved)3.The cost of your dream home (total_cost)
