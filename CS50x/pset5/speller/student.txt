The

He
begins

new

But
something
seems
to
come
over
him
now
He's
restless
Slowly
his
playing
drifts
off
his
fingers
charting
their
own
path

we
hear

Mia

She
sees
Sebastian

Is
instantly
struck
by
his
playing
MIA
SEBASTIAN'S
THEME
Gradually
all
sounds
but
the
music
drop
out
We
drift
away
from
reality
Even
the
walls
seem
to
go
slightly
darker
as
though
Sebastian
Mia
were
all
alone
He
concludes
his
piece
with
a
jumble
of
chords
his
playing
almost
free
jazz
now
as
we
pull
back
to
real
life
see
the
Boss
looking

scorn

Sebastian

Silence
Mia
looks
like
the
wind
has
been
out
of

Sebastian
looks
up
for
a
second
sees
her
They
look
at
one
Just
a
moment
Then
the
Boss
taps
Sebastian
on
the
shoulder
WE
STAY
ON
Mia
as
she
watches
Sebastian
rise
with
the
Boss
We
just
see
the
Boss
talking
to
Sebastian
can't
hear
what
is
said
Then
we
get
closer
realize
BOSS
every
goddamned
night
Sebastian
is
silent
Then
doesn't
want
to
have
to
beg
but
SEBASTIAN
I'll
stick
to

I
promise
BOSS
Too

You're

SEBASTIAN
You're
not
gonna

Do

walks
off

linger
on

giving
way
to
hurt
He
starts
hurrying
toward
the
door
BACK
TO
Mia
who
didn't
hear
what
was
said
She
watches

takes
a

Sebastian
just
walks
right
by

bumping
against

added
of
disdain
He
heads
out

Slams

romanticism

setting
this
moment
being
lost
here
at
night
alone
together
atop
a
hill
the
city
before
them
It's
no
big
deal
nothing
they
haven't
seen
or
felt
before
because
after
all
there's
no
chance
for
romance
between
them
Of
course
the
music
swelling
building
suggests
otherwise
Mia
tires
of
her
heels
finds
a
bench
fishes
for
flats
in
her

Sebastian
sits
beside
her
as
she
slips
the

on

look
at

suspicious

He
moves
his
foot
She
moves
hers
They
look
at

again
Still
suspicious
He
moves

She
moves

seem
to
be
moving
in

without

even
wanting
to

they've
almost
slipped
into

rises

two
look

Run
back

out

magic

They

more

as
surprised

we
are
to
find
that
they
can
really

this
starts
to
look
like
a
blossoming

real

peeking
through
our

Well

SEBASTIAN
You're

What
do
you
just

SEBASTIAN
You
said
it
yourself
you're
a
child
prodigy
playwright
MIA
That
is
not
what
I
said
SEBASTIAN
You're
too
modest
to
say
it
but
it's
true
So
you
could
write
your
own
roles
Write
something
that's
as
interesting

you

Last
thing
I
wrote
was
a

It
was
horrible
SEBASTIAN
All
I'm
saying
is
Louis

could
have
played

made

I

It
when
I
listen

I
don't
like

SEBASTIAN
But
it's
such

statement
It's

I

SEBASTIAN
CONT'D
Most
people
say
they
hate
jazz
because
they
don't
have
context
They
don't
get
where
it
came
from
All
these

packed
into

speaking

different

was
how
they
talked

Right

it's

Where
I

they'd
play
at

parties
whenever
they
served

SEBASTIAN
Mia
These
are
things
you
can't
unsay
She
bursts
into
laughter
Sebastian
points
to
the

SEBASTIAN
CONT'D
It's
not
cocktail
music
it's
a
high
wire
act
These
guys
are
performing
composing
rearranging
all
at

A

Mia
looks

We
DRIFT
over

SEBASTIAN
CONT'D
That's

you
need

be

This
whole

it's
dying
In

they'll
head
off

or
do
pit
at

cause
they
have
to
but
when
I
have
my

they'll
play

they
want
Mia
looks
at
Sebastian
Her
laughter
has
subsided
She
can
see
something
in
him
now
the
same
passion
he's
speaking
of

Your

SEBASTIAN
It's
gonna
be

old
Van

I'm
getting

It'll

He
watches
the

Lost
in

Then
sincere
SEBASTIAN
CONT'D
The

tells
everyone

Says

Inside
a
JAZZ
COMBO
is
tearing
through
a
fast
bop
chart
The
seats
around
the
band
are
almost
all
occupied
Young
fans
older
couples
passersby
trickling
in
from
outside
It's
excited
crowd
far
more
varied
than
what
we
saw
at
the
Lighthouse
a
real
range
of
ages
styles
Mia's
drift
as
David
heads
to
the

She
recognizes

Recognizes

Mia
She
turns
to
David
Wavering
unsure
what
to
do
she
follows
him
as
he
manages
to
find
two
seats
close
to
the
bandstand
The
combo
finishes
Hearty
applause
A
young
PIANIST
rises
from

then
Sebastian
appears
Mia

The

you
can
tell
it's
the
first

Sebastian
is

Welcome
to
Seb's
More
applause
Sebastian
sits
at
the
piano
Looks
at
the
keys
He
seems
uncertain
perhaps
unsure
what
to
play
He
looks
at
Mia
Takes
the
sight
in
Beat
Then
looks
at
his
fellow
musicians
Murmurs
to
them
Then
turns
back
to
the
keys
finally
starts
playing
Revision
A
quieter
tune
just
piano
soft
tender
A
we
Mia
instantly
recognize
It's
Mia
Sebastian's
song
Mia
looks
at
Sebastian
He
looks
at
her
then
back
at
his
keys
This
is
the
most
beautiful
we've
ever
heard
his
playing
The
most
tender
full
of
it
has
ever
sounded
We
MOVE
CLOSER
on
Sebastian
We
recognize
this
image
It
recalls
the
visualization
of
his
dream
back
at
the
RESTAURANT
that
night
in
winter
ago
Gradually
as
Sebastian
plays
his
surroundings
seem
to
grow
DARKER
Slowly
subtly
at
first
with
just
shifts
in
lighting
then
a
shift
in
perspective
the
interior
of
the
club
changes
soon
we
find
ourselves
back
at
that
same
RESTAURANT
Back
when
Mia
laid
on
Sebastian
for
the
first
time
Within
this
fantasy
flashback
Sebastian
finishes
his
piece
We
stick
on
Mia
watching
him
as
his
Boss
talks
to
him
All
is
as
before
as
we
remember
it
sure
enough
Mia
approaches
Sebastian
as
he
walks
near
her
MIA
I
just
wanted
to
say
I
saw
your
playing
I
but
instead
of
brushing
past
her
Sebastian
decks
her
with
a
kiss
for
the
ages
A
BURST
OF
ORCHESTRAL
MUSIC
The
DINERS
in
the
restaurant
spin
around
to
face
Mia
Sebastian
SNAP
their
fingers
in
time
Even
the
Boss
starts
to
DANCE

then
strut
out
together

Mia
Sebastian
walk
together
outside
but
now
that
we're
outside
we
realize
this
isn't
the
real
L
A
at
all
This
in
fact
is
L
A
that
doesn't
exist
A
painted
backdrop
L
A
just
like
the
one
we
saw
Mia
pass
by
when
parking
on
the
lot
The
old
orange
groves
the
gabled
rooftops
the
moss
covered
bungalows
the
ivy
decked

the
jacaranda
trees
the
giant

the
Santa

all
painted
all

all

up
to
Mia
seems
to
beckon
her
to
audition
We
see
the
audition
silhouetted
against
a
wall
We
don't
hear
Mia
sing
but
the
music
takes
on
the
of
her
song
carrying
us
to
PARIS
Sebastian
travels
there
with
Mia
We
chart
the
journey
through
OLD
the
same
one
we
saw
Mia
use
for
her
play
a
miniature
plane
dissolves
the
old
Hollywood
movie
way
Finally
we
find
ourselves
looking
at
a
PAINTED
BACKDROP
of
Paris
the
same
one
Mia
used
for
her
play
The
Sacr
Coeur
the
Arc
de
Triomphe
the
Eiffel
Tower
etched
in
bright
colors
the
ornate
lampposts
the
cobblestones
stretching
before
us
then
a

CAVEAU

HUCHETTE
We
see
a

session
at
the
Caveau
a
crypt
like

Sebastian
plays
on

nine
We
see
a

surrounded
by

We're
BACK
to
the

The

go

except
for

out
a

We
MOVE

close
on
his

DIVE
into

into
NIGHTTIME
PARIS
All
painted
Mia
Sebastian
wander
through
this
wonderland
pedestrians
frozen
around
them
Finally
they
stop
look
at
one
as
the
city
lights
behind
them
start
to
like
all
the
stars
of
the
galaxy
they
DANCE
Revision
This
is
the
last
time
we'll
ever
see
them
dance
they
seem
to
recognize
that
so
graceful
poised
are
their
movements
Remember
this
is
a
romance
more
perfect
than
a
real
romance
could
ever
be
We
DISSOLVE
again
to
a
projector
beam
footage
plays
on
a
screen
full
of
scratches
pockets
of

Mia
Sebastian
sit
down
to
watch
together
we
see
the
following
moments
in
brief
vivid
as
we
move
in
closer
on
the
imagery
The
first
home
Mia's
pregnancy
The
newborn
child
The
child's
first
birthday
The
child's
first
day
of
pre
school
all
dressed
up
Everything
here
with
the
warmth
of
old
home
movies
These
are
fluttering
by
grabbed
at
random
all
concocted
dreamed
up
out
of
nothing
The
SCORE
continuing
to
sway
taking
us
right
up
to
Sebastian
Mia
husband
wife
father
mother
hiring
a
babysitter
because
they've
decided
to
go
out
for
a
night
at
the
movies
We're
back
to
now
The
look
here
is
unaffected
just
everyday
The
MUSIC
quiets
slightly
everything
goes
more
as
this
happily
married
couple
hit
the
road
then
find
themselves
blocked
by
a
traffic
jam
then
take
a
side
route
winding
up
in
part
of
L
A
then
walk
down
the
street
then
hear
music
a
jazz
combo
playing
somewhere
step
into
a
place
that
looks
just
like
Sebastian's
club
They
sit
down
to
listen
then
this
is
how
our
imagined
montage
musical
number
ends
the
combo's
PIANIST
who
of
course
is

Sebastian
launches
into

Sebastian's
Mia
Sebastian
look
at

The
music
goes
full
circle
back
to
where
it
started
as

look
into
each

softly
but
with
all

She's

Then
she
looks
at

MIA
No
We
should
go
He
nods
They
rise
from
their
seats
head
for
the
exit
Just
as
they
reach
the
door
as
David
steps
out
Mia
turns
looks
back
at
Sebastian
He
looks
at
her
Their
lock
A
hint
of
a
tear
in
both
ever
so
subtly
for
just
a
fleeting
second
Mia
smiles
It's
the
kind
of
smile
you
could
miss
if
you
blinked
but
it's
enough
to
signal
to
Sebastian
that
she
recognized
the
he
played
that
she
still
remembers
it
still
thinks
of
it
to
this
day
Then
she
walks
out
the
door
Sebastian
at
his
fellow
musicians
Then
he
nods
they
launch
into
