        <p>“xQc” (or “xQcOW”) is the online pseudonym of Canadian professional 'Twitch' streamer and gamer Félix Lengyel. He primarily plays 'Overwatch' and represents the e-sports team 'Los Angeles Gladiators,' as a substitute main tank. He started his professional gaming career playing as the leading tank for the 'Overwatch League' franchise 'Dallas Fuel' during the first half of the league's inaugural season. In the subsequent seasons, xQc reached the top spot of the 'Overwatch' roster. However, his gaming career has been tainted with several controversies that have led him to being suspended and fined. xQc had once announced his retirement from professional gaming, to become a full-time streamer on 'Twitch.' However, he has now resumed his professional gaming career</p>

        <p>Qc began his gaming career as a main tank player for 'Overwatch' team ‘Q?’ His team was later picked up by 'Denial eSports,' and 5 months later, he played his first tournament at the 'Rivalcade Weekly #3 North America.' The group later disbanded, but before that, xQc and 'Denial eSports' won two championships. His team was renamed 'YIKES!' and then 'Arc 6.' xQc and his team were eliminated in the group stage of the 'Overwatch Contenders 2017: Season Zero,' which was a massive loss for the team. This eventually caused the disbandment of 'Arc 6' just before the 'Overwatch League Season 1.'</p>
