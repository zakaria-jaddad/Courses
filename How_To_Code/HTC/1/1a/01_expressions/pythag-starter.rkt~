; Language should be BSL
;PROBLEM:

;Assume that the two short sides of a right triangle have length 3 and 4.
;What is the length of the long side? Recall that the Pythagorean Theorem
;tells us that:


;Write a BSL expression that produces the the value of ? for this triangle
;where the other two sides have lengths 3 and 4.

;Solution
(sqrt (+ (sqr 3) (sqr 4)))
